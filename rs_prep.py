# Rapidstart Invoice/Item Charge Sequence Generator

# The purpose of this script is to generate two columns of invoice/item charge line coordinates expressed as (inv, item)
# in order automate the entering of a consolidated invoice into a Rapidstart import package. The script first starts by reading
# from three columns of data inputted in the container_config file by the end-user. The first two columns are all Posted invoice
# No.'s and references to all item-applied invoice charge line no.'s, which are expressed in consecutive increments of 10,000 starting from 10,000.
# Duplicates of any row from these first two columns represent multiple items being applied from the same invoice charge line. Finally, the third
# column represents a filtered list of invoice line no.'s the end-user has already prepared in advanced for any invoice charge line desired for applying
# to items.

# The script operates first by creating a list beginning with the first item in the filtered invoice line no.'s to be posted column.
# It then reads down the rows of columns A and B and either repeats the current iterated filter invoice line no. and appends
# to the list if there are no changes in sequences from either of the first two columns. Once the break in sequence occurs, the script
# increments the current iteration by 10,000 and repeats the process until it has exhausted the number of rows from column's A and B.
